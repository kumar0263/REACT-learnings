Creating an h1 tag using DOM

legacy.reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html -> we copied 
the code from this and pasted into our local react and 
react-dom.js and were able to use the react library

learnt how previously the react application was built (CDN)
and how we are gonna build now-a-days(CRA)

NPM -> Node Package Manager 
CRA -> Create React application

CDN -> we import code and use those prewritten code of js
and write the code for react but it was more and hectic 
so now we are using create react app modern days of 
creating react application
